title: "Distribution of $$dN/dS$$ values."
description: "The distribution of site-wise $$dN/dS$$. It displays the expected distribution of rates. The solid black line is the fit of a gamma distribution to the count data. In all subplots we have included a dashed line at $$dN/dS = 1$$ which is the traditional cutoff for positive selection. In A, we show the distribution of $$dN/dS$$ for the capsid. In B, we show the distribution of $$dN/dS$$ for the gp120 protein. In C, we show the distribution of $$dN/dS$$ for the matrix. In D, we show the distribution of $$dN/dS$$ for the integrase. In E, we show the distribution of $$dN/dS$$ for the protease. In F, we show the distribution of $$dN/dS$$ for the reverse transcriptase."
